This repo powers the [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site hosted at [janosh.io](https://janosh.io). I use this site to write about my personal interests, ranging from theoretical physics to machine learning, web development, spending time outdoors... oh and not to forget breaking conventions.

The site is built with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-06-16-announcing-gatsby-v2-beta-launch) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com). Feel free to reuse any part of the source code to create your own Gatsby site.

## Development

Assuming you have `git`, `node` and `yarn` installed, all you need to do to get this site running locally and start playing around with it is:

1. Clone the repo and open a command prompt inside it.
2. Run

```
yarn
```

3. Run

```
gatsby develop
```
