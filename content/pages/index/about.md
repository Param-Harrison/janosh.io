I am a theoretical physicist at Cambridge University trying to solve [physics problems](/physics) with [machine learning](/ai).

I am a would-be but of course full-stack [web](./web) developer.

I enjoy photography. You can take a look at some of my shots [right here](/photography).

I went vegan in April 2014. Never looked back. :)

I used to be a drummer in a band. Nowadays I just play for fun.
