This is a compilation of lecture notes and solutions to problem sheets for some of the most exciting physics lectures I took thus far. During my studies, I often read the solutions to exercises uploaded by other physics students around the world. They frequently opened up a new perspective or offered a way out when I got stuck on a problem. In the hopes that I might provide similar help to others, Iâ€™m uploading some of the solutions I typed up over the years.

If one of my solutions helped you or you found an error, drop me a line at [janosh.riebesell@gmail.com](mailto:janosh.riebesell@gmail.com).
