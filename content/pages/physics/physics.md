This is a compilation of notes and solutions to problem sheets for some of my most interesting physics lectures.

During my studies, I often read the solutions to exercises uploaded by other physics students around the world. They frequently opened up a new perspective or offered a way out when I got stuck on a problem. In the hopes that I might provide similar help to others, Iâ€™m uploading some of the solutions I typed up over the years.
