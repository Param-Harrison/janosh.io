  This is a compilation of lecture notes and
  solutions to problem sheets for some of the most
  exciting physics lectures I took thus far.

  During my studies, I often read the solutions to exercises
  uploaded by other physics students around the world. They
  frequently opened up a new perspective or offered a way out
  when I got stuck on a problem. In the hopes that I might provide
  similar help to others, Iâ€™m uploading some of the solutions I
  typed up over the years.
